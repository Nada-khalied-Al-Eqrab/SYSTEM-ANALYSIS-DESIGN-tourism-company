# Tourism Company - System Analysis and Design

This project focuses on the analysis and design of a system for a travel agency. The goal is to create a system that can manage all aspects of travel agency operations, from booking flights to managing customers.

## Project Overview

The travel agency system will manage multiple aspects of operations, including:

*   **Flight Management:** Register flight information, define their destinations, and manage their bookings.
*   **Hotel Management:** Register hotel information, define their rating, and manage their bookings.
*   **Customer Management:** Register customer information, track their interests, and manage their interactions with the agency.
*   **Booking Management:** Record flight and hotel bookings, manage invoices, and track payments.
*   **Employee Management:** Manage employee information, assign tasks, and track their performance.
*   **Report Management:** Generate periodic reports on flights, hotels, sales, and employee performance.

## System Architecture

The system architecture will consist of the following components:

*   **User Interface:** A user-friendly graphical interface for employees and customers.
*   **Database:** Stores all system data, including information on flights, hotels, customers, bookings, and employees.
*   **Flight Management Module:** Manages all aspects of flight information, from registration to managing their bookings.
*   **Hotel Management Module:** Manages all aspects of hotel information, from registration to managing their bookings.
*   **Customer Management Module:** Registers customer information, tracks their interests, and manages their interactions.
*   **Booking Management Module:** Records flight and hotel bookings, manages invoices, and tracks payments.
*   **Employee Management Module:** Manages employee information, assigns tasks, and tracks their performance.
*   **Report Management Module:** Generates periodic reports on flights, hotels, sales, and employee performance.

## Diagrams

The following diagrams will be created as part of the system analysis and design process:

*   **Context Diagram (Three Levels):**
    *   Level 0: Shows the system as a whole and the interactions with external entities, such as customers, airlines, and hotels.
    *   Level 1: Shows the major processes within the system, such as flight management, hotel management, and booking management.
    *   Level 2: Provides more details about the sub-processes within each major process.
*   **Database Diagram:** Illustrates the structure of the database, including tables and the relationships between them.
*   **Other Diagrams:** Use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, data flow diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams.

## Project Status
